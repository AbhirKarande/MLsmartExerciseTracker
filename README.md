# MLsmartExerciseTracker
A functioning exercise tracker that makes use of accelerometer sensor data and an onboard machine learning model to display what exercise is being done. 

J48 Decision Trees were used for the classification of the different movements. The code was written in an Android Wear OS environment. 

Here is a link to a video discussion of the process of making it all work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWwZ05N6ddU&ab_channel=AbhirK

*Updates: Have decided to get this project up and running again and make the service more robust. Here are a few ToDo's that will be implemented and once these are done, we will go from there:

ToDos:
-Make activity classification more robust
-Maintain a historical count of time spent doing exercises
-Include other metrics for tracking exercises, (e.g. repititions)
-Improve UI on watch
